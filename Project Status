This marks the completion of Version 1 (MVP) of the project.

The primary objective was to design and implement a functional solution that demonstrates the core idea and workflow effectively.

1. The current version focuses on:

2. A working end-to-end flow

3. Clear user interaction and outputs

4. Practical use of chosen technologies

Future iterations may build upon this foundation by introducing additional features, improved performance, and enhanced scalability.
